working on a website for waazam and its streaming protocol

waazam.com

The streaming protocol connects two home computers directly to exchange video, depth, audio, and OSC messages. The two users just have to be Gchat contacts or connected through another similar chat service.

We want to share this streaming protocol to help others make creative applications with it. Hence the website.
